# plotlyMol

A package to create molecular representations using the base Python Plotly. 


For the future:

- 2D: give chemdraw like structures
- 3D: 
	- draw 3D structures 
		- add in the ability to scale the position of the half-bond by the van der waals radii of the atoms at either end. 
	- add orbitals and other surfaces
	- for smiles: need to be able to handle add structures
- 4D: Animations
- GUI
	- ability to toggle aspects of the presentation/hover/etc
	- ability to dynamically enter mol information
